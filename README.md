## How to Print?

STLs are present within specific project folder.

Ready to be downloaded, sliced, and printed. STLs and previews are auto generated from SCAD files and are always up to date. 

## How to tweak?

Make any necessary changes locally to OpenScad, render and export STL using UI. Or generate them programmatically using [Docker](/DOCKER.md).
